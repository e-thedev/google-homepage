This will be my first project with Odin, I will be recreating the Google homepage.
Things that I have done.
Create and clone a New Repository from Github onto Local machine using Git (used SSH).
Used "git add ." to stage updated information from README file, used "git commit -m" to commit to updated changes, used "git status" to view staging update.
Used "git remote add origin + HTTPS" to add where README will be pushed, used "git push -u origin main" to push all updated changes within directory to Github.
Learned to section out parts of code in order to read it more easily "<!----!>".
Learned how to import images to webpage and add search bars with "<input>"
