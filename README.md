This will be my first project with Odin, I will be recreating the Google homepage.
Things that I have done.
Create and clone a New Repository from Github onto Local machine using Git (used SSH)
Used "git add ." to stage updated information from README file, used "git commit -m" to commit to updated changes, used "git status" to view staging update
